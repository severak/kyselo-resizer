# Kyselo resizer

makes your multimedia smaller with server magic...

Kyselo social network / meme wholesale storage has always stored only high quality memes [without any other digital artifacts](https://xkcd.com/1683/). 
This is fine when you reupload something you stolen from other social networks (with watermarks and plenty of compression on it). 
But when you start posting some original content suddenly 2MB photo limits becomes a problem. 
This repository is a solution - simple web app which compress your uploaded content.
